          After evaluating over 60 sites in 13 states for the Flux Motors
          factory, we chose a 500-acre property in Casa Grande, Arizona. Located
          between Phoenix and Tucson — and within easy reach of our Silicon
          Valley headquarters — the Casa Grande offered close proximity to
          critical utilities, an established transportation system, and strong
          support from state and local governments.

          This facility is the first greenfield — or purpose-built — EV factory
          in North America. Designed to our exact specifications, it is being
          built with such efficiency and speed that we will complete
          construction of its first phase a mere 12 months after breaking
          ground. Outfitted with the world’s most advanced production line
          equipment, the factory will have the initial capacity to produce
          10,000 cars a year — and over 300,000 annually with planned expansion.
