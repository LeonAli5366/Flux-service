          After evaluating over 60 sites in 13 states for the Flux Motors
          factory, we chose a 500-acre property in Casa Grande, Arizona. Located
          between Phoenix and Tucson — and within easy reach of our Silicon
          Valley headquarters — the Casa Grande offered close proximity to
          critical utilities, an established transportation system, and strong
          support from state and local governments.

        Introducing the inaugural greenfield venture in North America, our EV factory proudly stands as a purpose-built marvel. Meticulously tailored to our precise requirements, this facility is swiftly rising from the ground with unrivaled efficiency and speed, aiming to complete its initial phase in a mere 12 months. Equipped with cutting-edge production line technology, it will possess the capability to manufacture 10,000 cars annually, with aspirations to exceed 300,000 through future expansions.
