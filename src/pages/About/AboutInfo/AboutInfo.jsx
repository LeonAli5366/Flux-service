        After a thorough analysis, we deliberated extensively on the choice of
        establishing a U.S. base headquarter. With careful consideration, we
        meticulously evaluated over 60 potential locations across 13 states,
        closely examining the Flux Technologies U.S. Motors factory, until
        finally deciding to plant our roots in the sprawling landscape of Casa
        Grande, Arizona. Settled on an impressive 500-acre property, this
        selected site occupies a perfect position between the vibrant cities of
        Phoenix and Tucson, conveniently accessible from our Silicon
        Valley-based U.S. headquarter. Casa Grande truly stood apart due to its
        exceptional advantages, boasting close proximity to crucial utilities, a
        well-established transportation system, and unwavering support from both
        state and local governments.
