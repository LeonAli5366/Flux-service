          The spirit of California moves us to think beyond mobility, and design
          for a world where life is the most important journey we’ll ever take;
          to look beyond tomorrow and shape a future where we no longer have to
          choose between doing great things and doing the right thing; and to
          explore beyond ourselves, and create experiences that remind us what
          it’s like to feel truly alive.
